# Career Highlights Database Fix

## Problem Description

The career highlights section was causing the artist profile save to hang indefinitely because:

1. **Large JSONB Arrays**: Career highlights were stored as JSONB arrays in the main `artist_profiles` table
2. **Database Performance Issues**: Large JSONB objects can cause database timeouts and performance problems
3. **Complex Data Structure**: The array contained objects with year, title, and description fields
4. **Update Conflicts**: Multiple simultaneous updates to the same JSONB field can cause conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separate Database Table

Created a dedicated `career_highlights` table to store highlights as individual records:

```sql
CREATE TABLE career_highlights (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_profile_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES artist_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    year VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Database View for Easy Access

Created a view that aggregates career highlights back into JSON format for the frontend:

```sql
CREATE VIEW artist_profiles_with_highlights AS
SELECT
    ap.*,
    COALESCE(
        json_agg(
            json_build_object(
                'id', ch.id,
                'year', ch.year,
                'title', ch.title,
                'description', ch.description
            ) ORDER BY ch.year DESC, ch.created_at DESC
        ) FILTER (WHERE ch.id IS NOT NULL),
        '[]'::json
    ) as career_highlights
FROM artist_profiles ap
LEFT JOIN career_highlights ch ON ap.id = ch.artist_profile_id
GROUP BY ap.id;
```

### 3. Efficient Update Function

Created a database function to efficiently update all career highlights at once:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION update_artist_career_highlights(
    p_artist_profile_id UUID,
    p_highlights JSON
)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    highlight JSON;
BEGIN
    -- Delete existing highlights for this artist
    DELETE FROM career_highlights WHERE artist_profile_id = p_artist_profile_id;

    -- Insert new highlights
    FOR highlight IN SELECT * FROM json_array_elements(p_highlights)
    LOOP
        INSERT INTO career_highlights (
            artist_profile_id,
            year,
            title,
            description
        ) VALUES (
            p_artist_profile_id,
            (highlight->>'year')::VARCHAR(4),
            (highlight->>'title')::VARCHAR(255),
            (highlight->>'description')::TEXT
        );
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `create-career-highlights-table.sql` - Database migration
- `src/services/careerHighlightsService.ts` - Dedicated service for career highlights
- `test-career-highlights.js` - Test script for verification

### Modified Files

- `src/services/efficientArtistProfileService.ts` - Updated to handle career highlights separately
- `src/pages/ArtistProfileManager.tsx` - Added remove button and improved interface

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `create-career-highlights-table.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Step 2: Test the Migration

Run the test script to verify the database structure:

```bash
cd musistash-platform
node test-career-highlights.js
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend

The frontend has been updated to:

- Use the new `CareerHighlightsService` for career highlights operations
- Handle career highlights separately from the main profile update
- Provide better UI with remove buttons for individual highlights

## Benefits of This Solution

### Performance Improvements

- **Faster Updates**: No more large JSONB operations
- **Better Scalability**: Individual records instead of large arrays
- **Reduced Database Load**: Smaller, more efficient queries

### Data Integrity

- **Atomic Operations**: Each highlight is a separate record
- **Better Constraints**: Proper foreign key relationships
- **Easier Backup/Restore**: Individual records are easier to manage

### User Experience

- **Faster Saves**: No more hanging on career highlights
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear success/failure feedback
- **Improved Interface**: Remove buttons for individual highlights

### Developer Experience

- **Cleaner Code**: Dedicated service for career highlights
- **Better Testing**: Easier to test individual operations
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear separation of concerns

## Database Schema Comparison

### Before (Problematic)

```sql
-- In artist_profiles table
career_highlights JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb
```

### After (Optimized)

```sql
-- Separate table
CREATE TABLE career_highlights (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_profile_id UUID REFERENCES artist_profiles(id),
    year VARCHAR(4),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- View for frontend compatibility
CREATE VIEW artist_profiles_with_highlights AS
SELECT ap.*, json_agg(...) as career_highlights
FROM artist_profiles ap
LEFT JOIN career_highlights ch ON ap.id = ch.artist_profile_id
GROUP BY ap.id;
```

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Data

If you have existing career highlights data in the JSONB field:

1. **Backup existing data** before migration
2. **Extract highlights** from the JSONB field
3. **Insert into new table** using the migration script
4. **Remove old JSONB column** after verification

### Migration Script Example

```sql
-- Extract existing career highlights and insert into new table
INSERT INTO career_highlights (artist_profile_id, year, title, description)
SELECT
    id as artist_profile_id,
    (highlight->>'year')::VARCHAR(4) as year,
    (highlight->>'title')::VARCHAR(255) as title,
    (highlight->>'description')::TEXT as description
FROM artist_profiles,
     json_array_elements(career_highlights) as highlight
WHERE career_highlights IS NOT NULL
  AND career_highlights != '[]'::jsonb;
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a new artist profile** with career highlights
2. **Edit existing highlights** and save
3. **Add/remove highlights** and verify they persist
4. **Check database** to ensure data is stored correctly

### Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify database structure:

```bash
node test-career-highlights.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **View not found error**

   - Solution: Run the migration script again
   - Check if the view was created successfully

2. **Function not found error**

   - Solution: Verify the function was created in the migration
   - Check function permissions

3. **Foreign key constraint errors**
   - Solution: Ensure artist profile exists before adding highlights
   - Check that artist_profile_id is valid

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics after implementation:

- Profile save times
- Database query performance
- Memory usage
- User feedback on save operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Add support for bulk highlight updates
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed highlights
3. **Search/Filter**: Add search functionality for highlights
4. **Analytics**: Track highlight engagement and performance
5. **Validation**: Add more robust validation for highlight data

## Conclusion

This solution completely resolves the career highlights performance issue by:

- ✅ **Separating concerns**: Career highlights in their own table
- ✅ **Improving performance**: No more large JSONB operations
- ✅ **Enhancing reliability**: Atomic operations and better error handling
- ✅ **Maintaining compatibility**: View provides same interface for frontend
- ✅ **Future-proofing**: Scalable architecture for growth

The artist profile save operation should now be fast and reliable, even with many career highlights!
